The app lets users explore top-rated food reviews, read detailed feedback, post their own reviews, and save favourites for later. It features secure Google and email/password authentication, a fully dynamic navbar with user profile integration, and responsive UI built using Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, and SwiperJS. Reviews and favourites are stored in MongoDB, with server-side sorting, searching, filtering, and CRUD operations fully implemented. Users can add, edit, delete, and view their personal reviews, and also manage favourites. The entire application is optimized with proper loading states, error handling, and real-time UI updates, making it a smooth, modern, and production-ready food review experience.
